Ending mindless scrolling for good!
We're developing an educational app designed to engage kids in learning while they play:

1. Building a convolutional machine learning model to identify shapes and colors. 
2. Creating an iOS app featuring a roadmap with interactive levels where kids can explore and identify shapes and colors, powered by a convolutional neural network.
